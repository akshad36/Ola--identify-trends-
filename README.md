# Ola--identify-trends-
The primary goal is to extract insights from the booking data that can help Ola improve its services and understand customer behavior.

Size and Structure: The dataset contains over 70,000 records and 19 columns. Key columns include:
Booking Status: Indicates whether a ride was completed, canceled, or is still pending.
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Vehicle Type: Type of vehicle used for the ride (e.g., sedan, SUV).
Ride Distance: Distance covered during the ride.
Driver Ratings: Ratings given to drivers by customers.

Specific objectives include:
Analyzing successful bookings to understand trends.
Identifying cancellation rates and reasons for cancellations.
Evaluating customer engagement by tracking the number of rides per customer.
Assessing driver performance through ratings.
3. Data Cleaning
Excel Preparation: The speaker demonstrates how to clean the data using Excel, which may involve:
Removing duplicates.
Handling missing values.
Formatting data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Importing to SQL: After cleaning, the data is imported into SQL Workbench for further analysis.
4. SQL Analysis
The speaker uses SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Key queries include:
Successful Bookings: Retrieving all records where the booking status is marked as successful.
Average Ride Distances: Calculating the average distance for each vehicle type to understand which types are more popular or efficient.
Cancellation Rates: Counting the total number of canceled rides and analyzing the reasons behind cancellations.
Top Customers: Identifying the top five customers based on the number of rides taken, which can help in targeting loyalty programs.
Driver Ratings: Finding the maximum and minimum ratings for drivers associated with different vehicle types to assess performance.
Total Booking Value: Calculating the total revenue generated from successful rides.
Incomplete Rides: Listing all rides that were not completed along with reasons for incompletion.
5. Power BI Dashboard Creation
The speaker plans to visualize the analysis results using Power BI, which will include:
Ride Volume Over Time: A time series graph showing how the number of rides changes over days, weeks, or months.
Booking Status Breakdown: A pie chart or bar graph illustrating the proportion of successful, canceled, and pending rides.
Revenue by Payment Method: A visualization that breaks down total revenue based on different payment methods used by customers.
6. Presentation and Insights
The final step involves presenting the findings in a clear and effective manner. The speaker emphasizes the importance of:
Using visualizations to make data easily understandable.
Highlighting key insights that can inform business decisions, such as areas for improvement in customer service or operational efficiency.
